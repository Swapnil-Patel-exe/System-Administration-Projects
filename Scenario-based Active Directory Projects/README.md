Scenario #1 
Idea Corporation has an infrastructure with an AD, a webserver, and a file server. To enhance reliability, the company has now decided to create a high available environment where if any of the servers go offline, the server should automatically failover to the secondary server with zero downtime. Your manager has asked you to evaluate different solutions available and help set up a high-availability site.

Scenario #2
Idea Corporation acquired Bigbox Corporation and now wants to create two-way transitive domain trusts between both domains. Once this has been successfully configured, it will allow domains to communicate with one another. The goal is to share file server resources among both domains.
